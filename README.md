# HTML and CSS Clone - Mailchimp Signup Form

> From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/html-forms)

The project is a clone of the [Mailchimp signup form](https://login.mailchimp.com/signup/) using HTML and CSS. The CSS is written using BEM with PascalCasing, as recommended in the [Airbnb CSS style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/css).

The website uses CSS grid, flexbox, iframes and media queries to recreate the signup form layout. The custom CSS checkbox uses 4 lines of JavaScript to toggle the checked CSS class.
